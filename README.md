# King Kai's Planet – WebGL Physics Simulation

A WebGL-based graphics project simulating movement, gravity, and physics on King Kai's tiny planet (inspired by Dragon Ball).

## Features

- Custom WebGL rendering
- Curved small-planet gravity
- Basic camera and movement system
- Expandable physics engine

## How to Run the Project

You need a local server because browsers block file access for WebGL.

### Option A — Python (easiest)

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
